EDIT: I\\'ve uninstalled and reinstalled the app and I still get the same prompt that I have no balance. EDIT 2: Support stopped emailing me after telling me I can\\'t put my tips in my own bank account using the app and I asked what the \"Bank\" and \"Card\" buttons are for if that\\'s the case. Do not recommend this app.',\n",

They dont care whether or not you get the money you worked for.',\n",
