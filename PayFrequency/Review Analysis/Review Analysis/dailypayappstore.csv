1,"I helped out at an additional store last pay period. I didn’t get paid for one of my stores. When I called to fix it they pushed over a payment that was really a sort of pay-in-advance payment because the pushed forward money they didn’t have to back up that I DEFINITELY didn’t ask for. I asked for answers and what could be done, NOT borrowed money. Then that put my daily pay account into negative. I called for a week in a half to fix the problem by pay day today so I could get the money I deserve. No one on daily pay reached out to ever. I always called in. Despite them marking my account as urgent numerous times and filling escalation tickets nothing got done and magically for a week and a half while a called a manager was never in? It’s been 2 pay period and I haven’t gotten the money I worked for thanks to daily classifying my check wrong. A fixable problem that’s taken a week and a half just to be heard and hopefully it’ll be solved. And the best part is I can’t leave and get my money bc daily pay states I’ll lose access.

It serves it’s purpose and as long as your employer transmits accurately and on time. Then it works as intended. It’s very simple. For a minuscule fee, you can access your would be funds in advance.

6,Where do I even begin? Is it the fact that the app still isn’t optimized for modern iPhones? Is it the fact that instant payments are always being worked on? I’d get sometimes 2-3 emails a week telling me instant payments were down for maintenance. The company I worked for had to restrict access to early commission payouts through DailyPay because DailyPay overpaid everybody and had to retract it out of everyone’s next paycheck. How do you overpay an entire company when the whole point of your service is a glorified payroll product? I was laid off from the company I worked for that used DailyPay and I have now been on hold for 17 minutes at 9:30am to talk to someone because my final paycheck still hasn’t hit my bank account.

Now how does that work I’m so unhappy with this application that I will delete it ASAP. Don’t download or use this I feel like it’s a way for them to gather your personal data and to the creators of the app if you made a good app that actually worked I wouldn’t have said anything about it.
