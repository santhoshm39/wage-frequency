# Google-Play-Scraper Changelog

## v0.0.1.1
> Improved app detail feature
- Removed unnecessary fields.
    - scoreText : because 'score' is more accurate. ex) scoreText: '4.7', score: 4.73642
    - priceText : because 'price' is more meaningful. ex) priceText: '$3.49', price: 3.49
- Applied post processing to complex data to provide meaningful data.

- Added `summaryHTML` field : original data of html unescaped `summary` field.

## v0.0.1.2
> Increased stability - app detail feature
- By defining default values for each crawled element, crashes in the crawling process are significantly reduced.
- Therefore, no crash occurs even for a DOM that has no contents at all.
- It makes it possible to produce more realistic crawl results.
- Special Thanks to [DestroyLee](https://github.com/DestroyLee)
